                <h1>Welcome to Neutrino Physics Student Website</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the Neutrino Physics Student Website. This website is a part of my masters project in physics from the University of Sussex and it aims to catch up a student of physics to a level where they are able to being contributing to a particle physics experiment</p>
                <p>This project was born when my supervisor Lily Asquith lamented that there was no good resource or tutorial to teach me everything I needed to know to work on NOvA: so we thought we would make it.</p>
                <h2>Goals of this website</h2>
                <p>This website hopes to give students a practical introduction to the process of experimental particle physics. Modern particle physics experiments have many phases, incorporating design, simulation, machine learning and then the actual execution of the experiment. However, we tend to only see the final result watered down to one result in a textbook. This skips over a huge amount of work and detail, detail that might very well be necessary for your project. With any luck this will attempt to at least bridge that gap.</p>

                <p>While this website was made from the perspective of someone working most closely with the NOvA experiment, it should nevertheless be useful to anyone working in neutrino physics, and particle physics beyond.</p>
                <h2>Goals of NOvA</h2>

                <p>NOvA is the experiment most closely worked with. This is a Fermilab experiment in America. Neutrinos are produced in Chicago, where they are initially detected by the near detector. These neutrinos then travel through the earth to Northern Minnesota, where they are then again detected again. In this way, neutrino flavour oscillation can be accurately measured. Broadly NOvA has three goals: to understand neutrino oscillation, to understand neutrino mass organisation and to understand the symmetry between matter and anti-matter. More finely, its goals are to understand the mass hierarchy by determining if \(\nu_3\) has more or less mass than the other two states. Measure the amount of CP violation present, a measurement of \(\delta\). Measure the PMNS mixing angle \(\theta_{13}\). Determine if the \(\nu_3\) state has more \(\nu_\mu\) or \(\nu_\tau\) admixture (whether \(\theta_{23} &gt; \frac{\pi}{4}\) or \(&lt; \frac{\pi}{4}\) ). The goal is to create a tool that summarises the physics up to this point and allows a student to aid in the discovery of new physics.</p>
                <h2>Sections</h2>
                <h3>Neutrino Physics</h3>
                <p>This section hopes to give a general overview of neutrino theory that is known so far. It covers topics like oscillation, neutrino mass, dark matter and early universe physics.</p>
                
                <h3>Detector Technology</h3>
                <p>This section hopes to show some of the techniques that are used in neutrino experiments. The topics covered aren't exhaustive of the techniques that are used as the number of experiments is far too high. However, it should provide a good starting point.</p>
                
                <h3>Simulation</h3>
                <p>There are a huge number of Monte Carlo techniques, however, we have focused on those most relevant to NOvA. This has been done in a style of very easy to follow, step by step, tutorials. A larger array of Monte Carlo techniques can be found in the references, should these be needed.</p>
                
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>This section focuses on the challenges that face NOvA of identifying very rare interactions in a sea of background chaos. To this end, we teach about classification deep learning problems. While other experiments might use other methods, we have focused on convolutional neural networks. Again, there are a lot of other places to learn about other techniques that can be followed in the references.</p>
